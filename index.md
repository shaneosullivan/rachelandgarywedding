The party starts at 4pm, but feel free to wander in earlier if it suits you, there will be people there to let you in. Parking will be a few metres away in a well signed area, please park there as there will not be sufficient parking at the house.

### Social Distancing

In the current climate, we are all concerned with the potential spread of Covid-19. As such, at both the hotel and the party there will be social distancing measures put in place. Please feel free to wear a mask if you feel it is appropriate. All activities will take place outdoors with plenty of space to maintain a friendly distance while still celebrating together.

### Getting Away

A large taxi will be on call all night for anyone who needs it. Please check with the staff if you need the taxi, they'll be happy to contact him.

### Contact

Gary & Rachel are reaching out to all guests via email or text, so please reply to them if you need anything.
